# Acumulus powershell GUI
Just a litle side project to play around with the Acumulus-API. (https://siel.nl/acumulus/API/)
I'am not a great developer or in anyway connected to Siel and Acumulus.

Start via click .\bin\Acumulus-powershellGUI.bat
Or right click .\bin\Acumulus-powershellGUI.ps1 and chouse: "run with powershell"

You will be asked for your Acumulus credentials.
